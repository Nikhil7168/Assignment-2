                A stalwart basketball coach is brave in his or her mind and also brave with his or her words.<br> A stalwart coach is a loyal coach and never throws players under the proverbial bus of critique or blame. A stalwart coach is a self-disciplined coach who always reframes the deficits into opportunities.
